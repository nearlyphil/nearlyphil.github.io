Welcome to the retroNUC blog! This is a companion space for all the other accounts set up for this project, which lets me go into a bit more detail about any guides, tools, or technical challenges I face along the way.

For now, go check out the [About](../about) page, where I go into detail about the goals of this project. And if you didn't come from the other accounts, I'd really appreciate a follow on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/retronuc) or a subscribe on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/channel/UCo4j1kka4cmMtiB4wrCtufw).
