The retroNUC project comes from a very ambitious idea:

> is it possible to have every game 

It's the dream of the 'video game super console', isn't it?

## Goals

  * In order to 

* Achieve the best _realistic_ experienceSet up a realistic experience while playing these games, if possible
  * As the games were meant to be played - No internal resolution boosting
  * Use RetroArch's overlay/shader systems where appropiate to emulate the look of CRT/LCD screens at a 4K resolution, without needing to invest in expensive older technology

* Present games in a user-friendly way that preserves the history

* Contribute back to video game emulation and preservation resources
  * Capture/gather my own screenshots and video clips where existing resources don't meet my own quality standards, and upload these 
  * Use my own coding and development experience to test and report issues, as well as submit bug fixes or feature improvements to open-source software such as emulators

* Develop my own skills in the following:
  * Familiarity with linux-based systems
  * 
  * Web development, markdown
